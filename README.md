# PanFrame Move Player

Removing the player from its current view and adding it to a different one is not working. By doing that, we still have sound, the seekbar continues to move forward but the player shows a black screen.

On the Android Monitor, the same message appears repeatedly : 
"E/GLConsumer: [SurfaceTexture-2-11807-0] checkAndUpdateEglState: invalid current EGLContext".
